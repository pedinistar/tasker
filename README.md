### **Project Title: Task Manager (To-Do App)**

#### **Overview**
The Task Manager is a web-based application that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. Users can create, update, delete, and categorize tasks, setting priorities and deadlines. The app includes user authentication, so each user has their own personalized task list.

#### **Tech Stack**
- **Backend**: Python with Flask or Django
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript
- **Database**: SQLite or SQLAlchemy for simplicity
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub for code management

#### **Features**

1. **User Authentication**
   - Users can sign up, log in, and manage their tasks securely.
   - Use Flask-Login or Django's built-in authentication system.
   
2. **Task CRUD Operations**
   - **Create**: Add new tasks with title, description, category, deadline, and priority.
   - **Read**: View all tasks in a dashboard, filtered by different criteria.
   - **Update**: Modify task details or mark tasks as completed.
   - **Delete**: Remove tasks from the list.

3. **Task Categorization**
   - Allow users to categorize tasks into different groups like Work, Personal, etc.
   - Users can filter tasks by category.

4. **Task Filtering and Sorting**
   - Filter tasks by status (e.g., Completed, Pending).
   - Sort tasks by deadline, priority, or category.

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Implement a responsive layout using Bootstrap to ensure the app works on both desktops and mobile devices.

6. **Search Functionality**
   - Allow users to search for tasks by title or description.

7. **User Interface**
   - Clean, modern, and intuitive UI with Bootstrap.
   - Use JavaScript for dynamic elements like modals and AJAX for smooth user experience.

8. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the app on a platform like Heroku or PythonAnywhere.
   - Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment (optional, but impressive).

#### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Set Up the Environment**
   - Install necessary packages using `pipenv` or `virtualenv`.
   - Initialize a Git repository and create a basic project structure.

2. **User Authentication**
   - Set up user models, views, and templates for registration and login.
   - Implement session management to keep users logged in.

3. **Task Model and CRUD**
   - Define the Task model with fields for title, description, category, priority, and deadline.
   - Create views and templates for task creation, updating, viewing, and deletion.
   - Link tasks to users via a foreign key to ensure personalized task lists.

4. **Categorization and Filtering**
   - Implement dropdowns or tabs for category selection.
   - Add views and filters to sort and display tasks based on different criteria.

5. **Responsive Design and UI Enhancements**
   - Use Bootstrap to make the app look good on all devices.
   - Add interactive elements using JavaScript/jQuery.

6. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for key functionalities using Python’s unittest framework or PyTest.
   - Test the app in different environments and browsers.

7. **Deployment**
   - Prepare the app for production by setting up environment variables and a production-ready server (e.g., Gunicorn for Flask).
   - Deploy the app on a cloud platform.
   - Add a custom domain and configure SSL if possible.

8. **Documentation**
   - Write a README.md with clear instructions on how to set up, run, and use the application.
   - Include screenshots and, if possible, a demo video.

9. **Bonus Features (Optional)**
   - **Notifications**: Set up email or push notifications for task reminders.
   - **API Integration**: Allow third-party integrations, like syncing tasks with Google Calendar.
   - **Themes**: Add light/dark mode switching.

#### **Expected Outcome**
By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional Task Manager web app that you can showcase on your resume and GitHub. It demonstrates your ability to work with Python, web frameworks, databases, and front-end technologies—all key skills for a Python developer.

This project is not just about building something; it's about learning and showing your potential to future employers.
